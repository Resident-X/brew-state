# Board design method

This is how a controller board is designed in KiCad so that it passes the pre-order check and works once built. The method works for any machine. A machine's own figures come from its own records, and this document names each record only by the role it plays: the machine's constraints record, its separation basis record, the requirements a board serves, and the manufacturer's stated limits.

A board is designed by an agent, with no person at the editor, and each step can be carried out by an agent session from its own text. The pre-order check that later holds a board to the rules KiCad's layout rule check enforces, and how to run it, are described in [`hardware/README.md`](../hardware/README.md).

## Tools

These are needed in addition to the tools the pre-order check needs (KiCad 10, Python, PyYAML, git and Task, listed in `hardware/README.md`). Every one is free.

| Tool | Version the commands below were exercised with | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| KiCad, with its command-line tool and the Python it bundles with its `pcbnew` module | KiCad 10.0.7 | https://www.kicad.org/download/ |
| Freerouting, the external router | Freerouting 2.5.0, the file `freerouting-2.5.0.jar` | https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting/releases (the v2.5.0 release, asset `freerouting-2.5.0.jar`) |
| A Java runtime, which Freerouting runs on | Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK 26.0.1 | https://adoptium.net/ or any other Java distribution. Freerouting 2.5.0 is built for Java 25, so it needs Java 25 or newer. |
| resvg, the SVG rasteriser that turns the [layout review views](#layout-review-views) into images | resvg 0.48.1; the command refuses one older than 0.48 | https://github.com/linebender/resvg/releases, one prebuilt program for each common operating system; or `brew install resvg`, or `cargo install resvg`. Set `RESVG=/path/to/resvg` when it is not on the search path. |

KiCad's bundled Python is the one that can `import pcbnew`. Its usual location:

| System | KiCad's Python |
|---|---|
| macOS | `/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3` |
| Windows | `C:\Program Files\KiCad\10.0\bin\python.exe` |
| Linux (distribution package) | the system `python3`, which the package gives the `pcbnew` module |

To check it, run `<KiCad's Python> -c "import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.Version())"`. It should print the KiCad version. The commands below write this Python as `KICAD_PYTHON` and the router's jar file as `FREEROUTING_JAR`. Replace them with the paths on your machine.

The commands below are written for a POSIX shell, the terminal on macOS or Linux, and were exercised on macOS. On Windows, run them in PowerShell. The `task` commands are typed as written. In the others, write `$env:KICAD_PYTHON` and `$env:FREEROUTING_JAR` where a command says `"$KICAD_PYTHON"` and `"$FREEROUTING_JAR"`, and start a command that begins with KiCad's Python with `& `, for example `& $env:KICAD_PYTHON -c "import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.Version())"`. Set them with `$env:KICAD_PYTHON = "C:\Program Files\KiCad\10.0\bin\python.exe"`. The Windows forms have not been exercised.

KiCad's bundled Python is used here only for the router's export and import. In KiCad 10.0.7 its `pcbnew` module was found unreliable for anything else: some objects it returns come back unwrapped, without their methods, so a net's class could not be asked for its clearance. Nothing else in this method reads or changes the board through it.

### The board editor, driven by an agent

The agent drives KiCad's editors through the Konnect MCP server, and runs every other command in this document from a shell. Konnect loads its tools in toolsets, mid-session. A toolset is visible only to the session that loaded it, not to a subagent spawned from that session, so routing and locking run in the session that loaded the board toolsets.

Konnect's editing tools act on the board through KiCad's IPC interface, so they need the board open in the board editor of the KiCad that Konnect reaches. Konnect reaches one KiCad only: the one holding KiCad's default IPC endpoint, which the first KiCad started takes. A board editor started while another KiCad is running takes an endpoint of its own, which Konnect does not reach (this was measured with KiCad 10.0.7 on macOS). So run one KiCad at a time while designing a board.

Several steps need the board closed in every editor: the editor does not see rules and classes written to the project until it opens the board again, and the board tooling and the router's export and import act on the board file outside the editor. Konnect has no tool that closes the board or the editor; its toolsets were searched for one. The agent's route is therefore not to hold the board open across those steps: it saves the board and quits the editor from a shell, then starts it again. To close the board:

1. Save it, with Konnect's `save_project`.
2. Quit the editor holding it. On macOS: `osascript -e 'quit app "pcbnew"'` for a board editor started on its own, or `osascript -e 'quit app "KiCad"'` for the board editor opened from KiCad's project window. On Windows: `taskkill /IM kicad.exe` or `taskkill /IM pcbnew.exe`, without `/F`, which asks KiCad to close rather than ending it. On Linux: close its windows through the desktop, for example `wmctrl -c KiCad`. Quitting asks first if the board has unsaved changes, which is why it is saved first.
3. Check that no KiCad editor is left running: `pgrep -lx kicad; pgrep -lx pcbnew` on macOS or Linux, `tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq kicad.exe"` and `tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq pcbnew.exe"` on Windows. Neither prints a process once KiCad has quit.

Quitting the board editor rewrites the project file, with KiCad's defaults filled in for settings it did not hold before, and writes `<board>.kicad_prl` beside it, which holds only the editor's own view settings. This was measured; the net class assignments and the text variables came through unchanged. Review the project file's change as you would any other.

To reopen the board: load Konnect's `verification` toolset and call its `launch_kicad_ui` naming the project. Then call Konnect's `open_project` naming the board. Carry on only when it reports the board open (`requested_open: true`). If it does not, start the board editor on the board from a shell, `open -a "/Applications/KiCad/PCB Editor.app" <board>.kicad_pcb` on macOS, `pcbnew <board>.kicad_pcb` on Linux, `& "C:\Program Files\KiCad\10.0\bin\pcbnew.exe" <board>.kicad_pcb` on Windows, and call `open_project` again. If it still reports the board not open, another KiCad holds the endpoint: close every KiCad as above and start again.

Of these, saving, quitting the board editor started on its own with `osascript`, the check with `pgrep`, starting the board editor from the shell, and `open_project` were exercised on macOS. `launch_kicad_ui` and the Windows and Linux forms were not.

While an editor holds a board open, KiCad keeps a lock file beside it, `~<board>.kicad_pcb.lck`, and `~<board>.kicad_pro.lck` for its project, and deletes both when the editor quits. The board tooling's lock, record and compare commands refuse to run while the board's lock file is there. The file holds only a user and host name, `{"hostname":"…","username":"…"}`, not a process, so it cannot say by itself whether an editor still holds the board. Ending the editor without quitting it, for example with a plain `kill` or after a crash, leaves both lock files behind: that was measured, as was quitting removing them. Tell a stale lock file from a live one this way:

- It is live while any KiCad editor could hold the board. If the check in step 3 above prints a process, the board may be open: if the only KiCad running is the one Konnect reaches, `open_project` naming the board says whether that KiCad holds it, and if it does, close the board as above.
- It is stale once the check in step 3 prints no process, or when the only KiCad running is the one Konnect reaches and `open_project` reports the board not open in it. Delete both lock files, `~<board>.kicad_pcb.lck` and `~<board>.kicad_pro.lck`.

Delete the project's lock file too, even though the board tooling looks only at the board's: a board editor reopening the board over a stale lock file with its own user and host name was measured to open it without asking and take over the board's lock file, but to leave the stale project lock file in place after it quit.

Where a judgement is visual, the agent looks at a rendered view of the board, never at the editor window: Konnect's export toolset and `kicad-cli pcb export svg` both render the board's layers, and `task hw:views` renders every view the layout review judges a board on ([Layout review views](#layout-review-views)). What to look for is the layout review step's.

## Rules before routing

Do this before any track is routed. Its purpose is that every rule the board is routed and checked against is written down, traceable to where its figure comes from, and that the table says which of them KiCad confirms on the board itself, which KiCad's rule check enforces before the board is ordered, and which, a net class's track width and via sizes, are only the defaults routing starts from.

Close the board in every editor before writing anything in this section, as [The board editor, driven by an agent](#the-board-editor-driven-by-an-agent) describes, and keep it closed until step 4. An editor holding the board keeps its own copy of the project file and writes that copy over the file when it quits: a text variable and a net class pattern written to the project file while the board editor held the board open were measured to be gone after it quit. Konnect's tools that write net classes write the project file, so they are no exception.

### 1. Write every rule and net class down, with its figure and source

Keep a table in a file named `design-rules.md` in the board's own folder, beside its KiCad project. Give it one row for every design rule and every net class the board uses:

| Rule or net class | Figure | Where it is set in KiCad | Source of the figure | Confirmed in effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|

- **Design rules** are the board-wide minimums (clearance, track width, via diameter and drill, hole size, annular ring, hole-to-hole, copper-to-edge, silkscreen), each custom rule in the board's rules file, and every net class's own clearance, track width and via sizes.
- **Source** says where the figure comes from, for example: the machine's constraints record (name the figure in it); a requirement the board serves (name the requirement); the manufacturer's stated limits (name the manufacturer and the date of the capability page the figure was read from); the separation basis record; or a finding from a layout review that became a rule (name the review). "Default", "typical" or "what KiCad had" is not a source.
- **Confirmed in effect** says, for each kind of row, what stands behind it, and nothing else may be written there:
  - a **custom rule** in the board's rules file: that KiCad loaded the rules file, from step 3's output;
  - a **net class**: the nets step 3 lists for it;
  - a **board-wide minimum**, and a **net class's own clearance**, set in Board Setup: `not confirmed by step 3; enforced by the layout rule check in the pre-order check`. Step 3 cannot read these figures, so they are never marked confirmed. They stand on the figure and source written in the row. KiCad's layout rule check reports copper, holes and silkscreen that break any of them, as an error, or as a warning for silkscreen clipped by the board edge, and the pre-order check (step 7 of routing) fails the board on either;
  - a **net class's own track width and via sizes**: `routing default only; not enforced`. KiCad starts a track or via on the class's nets at these sizes, but its layout rule check does not hold copper to them: a narrower track or a smaller via on such a net raises no violation of the class's figure, and the pre-order check passes it. A track width or via size the board relies on, such as a mains or power track's width, is therefore also written as a custom rule in the board's rules file, conditioned on the class, one constraint per rule:

    ```
    (rule "Power track width"
    	(condition "A.hasNetclass('Power')")
    	(constraint track_width (min 1.0mm)))
    (rule "Power via diameter"
    	(condition "A.hasNetclass('Power')")
    	(constraint via_diameter (min 1.2mm)))
    (rule "Power hole size"
    	(condition "A.hasNetclass('Power')")
    	(constraint hole_size (min 0.6mm)))
    ```

    `hole_size` holds every hole on the class's nets, pad holes as well as vias. Each such rule has its own row, with its figure and source, confirmed by step 3 like any custom rule and enforced by the layout rule check in the pre-order check.

A rule with no stated source fails this step. Give it a source or remove it.

### 2. Declare whether the board carries mains

Every board declares this in its project text variable `MAINS`, set to exactly `present` or `none`: in the project file, `"text_variables": {"MAINS": "present"}`. Write it into the project file, with the board closed in every editor. A board with no mains declaration fails this step, and the pre-order check fails it too.

**A board that declares `none`** puts no net in the `Mains` net class.

**A board that declares `present`**:

- assigns every mains-referenced net to the net class named exactly `Mains`. These are the nets at mains potential and those referenced to it, such as a switched live or the low side of a heater. You can assign a net in the schematic with a net class directive, or in the project's net classes by assignment or by pattern (Konnect's `create_netclass` and `assign_net_to_class` write them, and work with the board closed);
- writes the separation between mains and low-voltage copper as **one** custom rule in the board's rules file, `<board>.kicad_dru` beside the project, a text file written with the board closed in every editor. The rule must be exactly in this form:

  ```
  (version 1)
  (rule "Mains separation"
  	(condition "A.hasNetclass('Mains') && !B.hasNetclass('Mains')")
  	(constraint clearance (min <clearance>mm))
  	(constraint creepage (min <creepage>mm)))
  ```

  The condition is written exactly as shown, with no other spacing. The rule has no `(layer ...)` clause and no other narrowing by layer or area. It holds both a `clearance` and a `creepage` constraint, each in millimetres. `<clearance>` and `<creepage>` are no less than the separation basis record's mains-to-low-voltage clearance and creepage (`mains_to_low_voltage.clearance_mm` and `.creepage_mm` in the `separation-basis.yaml` that holds the board to its signed figures). In the table from step 1, both figures name that record as their source. The pre-order check accepts the rule in this form only, and holds the board to the record's figures whatever the rule states.

**Local clearance overrides can defeat the separation rule.** Pads, footprints and zones can each carry a clearance of their own, set outside the custom rules. A local clearance override on a pad or a footprint takes precedence over every custom rule in KiCad, which applies the larger of the two items' overrides. So a small override on either side of a mains/low-voltage pair would let low-voltage copper sit closer to mains than the separation rule allows. Treat a zone's own clearance the same way, although KiCad 10 (10.0.7) was measured not to let it outrank a custom rule. Set none of these below the separation basis record's clearance. The pre-order check fails any pad or footprint override that undercuts the signed figure, and any zone on a `Mains`-class net whose own clearance does. It checks a zone's clearance only on a `Mains`-class net. A zone's own clearance does not outrank the separation rule, so a low-voltage zone's cannot undercut it; a `Mains`-class zone is still held to the signed figure, so the board never states a smaller mains separation than the one it is checked against.

### 3. Confirm that KiCad loads the rules file and places each class's nets, by asking KiCad

With the board still closed, from the board's folder, run:

```
task hw:rules-confirm -- --board <board>.kicad_pcb --project <board>.kicad_pro --class <net class> [--class <net class> ...]
```

Name every net class in the table with its own `--class`, `Mains` among them on a board that declares mains. Give the board's own project file, the one beside it with its name. Set `KICAD_CLI` as `hardware/README.md` describes if `kicad-cli` is not on your search path.

The command never reads the rules or the classes from the files. It runs KiCad's own layout rule check on a copy of the board, with its project file and its own rules file, `<board>.kicad_dru`. A marker rule appended to that file fires only if KiCad loaded all of it, since KiCad drops a whole rules file it cannot parse, without saying so. One probe rule per class lists the nets KiCad places in that class. The command fails:
- when KiCad did not load the rules file, naming the rule KiCad rejects;
- when the board has no rules file. A board with no custom rules still has one, holding `(version 1)` alone;
- when a named class is not one the design defines, or KiCad places no net of the board in it;
- when `MAINS` is not exactly `present` or `none`, or is `present` and `Mains` is not named.

Otherwise it prints each class with the nets KiCad puts in it, and `RESULT | CONFIRMED`. Check each class's list against your intent: every net you meant to put in the class is there, and no other. A critical net missing from its list is in the wrong class.

Fill in the table's last column from this output: for each net class, the nets listed; for each custom rule, including one that holds a class's track width or via size, that KiCad loaded the rules file; for each board-wide minimum and each class clearance set in Board Setup, that step 3 does not confirm it and the pre-order check's layout rule check enforces it; and for each class's track width and via sizes, that they are a routing default only and not enforced, as step 1 says. A custom rule or net class row not filled in from this output fails this step, and so does a figure row marked confirmed, and a class track width or via size row marked enforced. So does a failure of the command.

What this confirms is that the rules file loads and that each class holds the nets intended. It does not show that each figure is the one KiCad applies, since a later rule can shadow an earlier one. The separation figure, the one that matters most, is enforced by the pre-order check's own rule whatever the board writes.

### 4. Close the board, and reopen it before routing

The board editor does not see rules or classes written to the project, or a rules file written beside it, until it opens the board again. This holds whether they were written by editing the files or through Konnect. So after step 3 and before routing anything, the board is closed in every editor, as it has been throughout this section, and then reopened, as [The board editor, driven by an agent](#the-board-editor-driven-by-an-agent) describes.

If an editor held the board open at any point in this section, close it now, and check that what you wrote is still in the project file and the rules file, since quitting the editor writes its own copy of the project file over the file. Write again whatever was lost, with the board closed, and repeat step 3 before reopening.

Out of scope for this section: the figures themselves, which come from the machine's constraints record and its separation basis record, and the automated check that later holds the board to the rules its layout rule check enforces, the pre-order check.

## Routing: critical nets by hand and locked, then the rest

The nets that decide whether a board works are never left to an automatic router. They are routed deliberately to their stated rules and locked. Automated routing is then run only one way: KiCad's exporter, the external router from its command line, then KiCad's importer (step 5). It places only what is left unrouted, and may not move a locked item. Locking is done by the board tooling's lock command on the closed board file (step 3). A check in the board tooling, never a comparison by hand and never the router's own report, confirms afterwards that nothing locked was moved and nothing was added to a critical net. Only the board's own tracks, arcs, vias and zones are locked and recorded; a copper zone inside a footprint is not covered.

### 1. Put every critical net in a named critical class

The critical classes include at least the board's **power**, **decoupling**, **ground**, **mains** and **sensing** paths. Assign every net in those categories to a named net class in step 1 of the rules section, for example `Power`, `Decoupling`, `Ground`, `Mains` and `Sensing`. The names are the board's own, and the mains class is always `Mains`. Every critical class is named to the lock and record steps below, which protect only the classes they are given. A critical net left in the `Default` class therefore fails this step: its copper would not be protected. The board tooling refuses what it can read: a named class holding no net, and, on a board that declares mains, a set of classes that leaves out `Mains`. Which other nets are critical it cannot read, so that stays your judgement.

Which further nets of a particular board are critical is that board's own design work.

### 2. Route every critical net by hand, to its class's rules

On the reopened board, route every net in every critical class yourself, to the rules its class states: every track, arc and via, with Konnect's routing tools. A copper zone on a critical net, such as a ground or mains pour, is deliberate routing like a track, so draw it yourself too. Do this in the session that loaded Konnect's routing toolset, not in a subagent, which would not see it. Look at a rendered view of the board to judge the result.

Save the board, with Konnect's `save_project`.

### 3. Close the board, and lock every critical item

Close the board in every editor, as [The board editor, driven by an agent](#the-board-editor-driven-by-an-agent) describes. Then, from the board's folder, run:

```
task hw:copper-lock -- --board <board>.kicad_pcb --project <board>.kicad_pro --class <critical class> [--class <critical class> ...]
```

Name every critical class with its own `--class`. This marks every track, arc, via and zone on a net KiCad places in those classes locked in the board file, writing `(locked yes)` where KiCad writes it and changing nothing else. It prints each item it locked, and each class with its nets. It refuses, and leaves the board unchanged, when:
- KiCad's lock file shows the board open in an editor;
- the project file is not the board's own;
- a named class is not one the design defines, holds no net, or is named twice;
- `MAINS` is not exactly `present` or `none`, or is `present` and `Mains` is not named.

A locked item is changed only by a deliberate re-route: remove it, route it again on the reopened board, then close the board and lock again. A re-route after recording needs a fresh record.

### 4. Record the critical-class copper, immediately before export

With the board still closed, from the board's folder, run:

```
task hw:copper-record -- --board <board>.kicad_pcb --project <board>.kicad_pro --class <critical class> [--class <critical class> ...] --record <work folder>/<board>.record.json
```

Name the same classes as step 3.

The record lists every track, arc, via and zone on a net KiCad places in those classes, each with its properties and whether it is locked, and the nets each class holds. It is a working file. Write it to a folder that is not inside any design's folder, and never commit it.

The command refuses, and writes no record, in each case step 3 refuses, and when:
- the record's path is inside the board's folder, or inside any folder that holds a KiCad project file;
- the record cannot be written where it was asked to go;
- any critical-class item is not locked. It names each one; lock again (step 3) and record again.

### 5. Export, route the rest externally, import

Before exporting, keep copies of the board file and the project file as they stand, so the board can be restored if step 6 fails: in the work folder, under names that do not end in `.kicad_pcb` or `.kicad_pro` (for example `<board>.kicad_pro.before`), since a folder holding a project file is a design's folder, where the record is refused. Or commit both.

KiCad 10's `kicad-cli` has no Specctra command. The exporter and importer are reached through KiCad's bundled Python, with these commands run from the board's folder. Do not substitute another tool's Specctra export: Konnect's own routing export, for one, refuses boards with rounded-rectangle pads.

Export the board for the router:

```
"$KICAD_PYTHON" -c "import pcbnew; b = pcbnew.LoadBoard('<board>.kicad_pcb'); assert pcbnew.ExportSpecctraDSN(b, '<work folder>/<board>.dsn')"
```

Locked items are exported as fixed (`(type fix)` in the `.dsn` file).

Run the router from its command line, with no window:

```
java -jar "$FREEROUTING_JAR" -de <work folder>/<board>.dsn -do <work folder>/<board>.ses --router.autorouter.max_passes=20 --gui.enabled=false
```

Import the router's session into the board and save it:

```
"$KICAD_PYTHON" -c "import pcbnew; b = pcbnew.LoadBoard('<board>.kicad_pcb'); assert pcbnew.ImportSpecctraSES(b, '<work folder>/<board>.ses'); b.Save('<board>.kicad_pcb')"
```

Saving this way also rewrites the project file, with KiCad's defaults filled in for settings it did not hold before. Review that change against the copy kept before export, as you would any other.

The router's own report, for example `0 unrouted and 0 violations`, is not evidence of anything. Neither the router nor the importer is relied on to leave locked copper alone.

### 6. Compare the imported board with the record

From the board's folder, run:

```
task hw:copper-compare -- --board <board>.kicad_pcb --project <board>.kicad_pro --record <work folder>/<board>.record.json
```

With the board still closed, give the same board, its own project file, and the record taken of that board in step 4. This fails, naming each item, when:
- a recorded item is missing;
- a recorded item is no longer locked;
- a recorded item is changed in any recorded property, with each changed property given as old → new;
- a critical-class net carries a track, arc, via or zone that the record does not hold;
- a critical class the record names is no longer defined by the design;
- `MAINS` is not exactly `present` or `none`, or is `present` and the record's classes leave out `Mains`.

The critical nets at comparison are every net the record names and every net the critical classes hold now, so a net that left its class after recording, for example because the import rewrote the project file, is still checked. An added item identical to a recorded one is still reported as added. Copper on nets outside both is the router's, and is ignored. A record taken of another board, a project file that is not the board's own, or a board KiCad's lock file shows open, fails the comparison without comparing anything. A failure fails this step whatever the router or the importer reported. Restore the board as it was before export, correct the cause, and repeat from step 2.

A board on which any critical-class net was placed by the router fails this step.

### 7. Run the board's own rule checks, then reopen the board

Run the pre-order check, which runs KiCad's own electrical and layout rule checks with zones refilled:

```
task hw:verify
```

It checks only designs git tracks (`git add` is enough), as `hardware/README.md` explains. It must pass. A router's or editor's "no violations" is never accepted in its place. Reopen the board in the editor, as [The board editor, driven by an agent](#the-board-editor-driven-by-an-agent) describes, only after this check and the comparison in step 6 have run, and only to continue work on it.

Out of scope for this step: judging the quality of the layout, which is the layout review step.

## Layout review views

An image of one layer shows no net names, so a ground drawn as a thin trace looks like any other track. The layout review therefore judges a board on an image of each layer (`layer-<layer>`) and on views that show each critical net against the board (`net-<net>`), the critical classes against each other (`classes`), each integrated circuit with the parts on its supply nets (`crop-<reference>`), each side as it is assembled (`assembly-top`, `assembly-bottom`), and the assembled board in three dimensions (`3d-top`, `3d-bottom`, `3d-angled`). It also uses a table of the facts a picture cannot carry. With the board closed in every editor, render them from the board's folder:

```
task hw:views -- --board <board>.kicad_pcb --project <board>.kicad_pro --class <critical class> [--class <critical class> ...] --out <work folder>/<board>-views
```

Name every critical class, as in routing step 3. The output folder is a working folder: it must be new or empty, and outside every design's folder. Never commit it. The views, their names, the index and the per-net fact table, and what the command refuses, are listed in [`hardware/README.md`](../hardware/README.md#the-layout-review-views). The command needs KiCad's command-line tool and resvg (see [Tools](#tools)).

**Resolution.** The views are drawn at

    pixels per millimetre = 3 / (the smaller of the board's minimum track width and minimum clearance, in millimetres)

so the smallest track and the smallest gap each span at least three pixels. Both minimums are read from the board's design rules, Board Setup's minimum track width and minimum clearance, whose figures and sources the board's rules table already carries (step 1 of [Rules before routing](#rules-before-routing)). The method itself therefore carries no manufacturer's figure. A board whose rules state either minimum as none, zero or less fails the command, naming the missing figure.

**Image size limit.** Every image is kept within a long edge of 1568 pixels, and within 1568 visual patches of 28 by 28 pixels. An image costs ⌈width / 28⌉ × ⌈height / 28⌉ patches. This is the standard tier of the model vendor's published limits, the tier for all models other than its high-resolution ones. An image over either limit is downscaled to the largest size that fits, keeping its aspect ratio, so an image within both is read at the resolution it was drawn at. The source is the "Resolution and token cost" section of https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision, read on 2026-10-13. That section also gives a high-resolution tier, a long edge of 2576 pixels and 4784 patches, for the vendor's newer models. The views keep to the standard tier, so every reviewing model reads them whole. Every two-dimensional view larger than the limit, a crop included, is cut into tiles. Each three-dimensional view is one image within it.

**Captions.** Every image carries a caption drawn into it. A two-dimensional view's caption states its layers, the colour of each layer or, on the class map, of each class, its net or class, its scale in pixels per millimetre and the board coordinates in millimetres it covers. A three-dimensional view's caption states its view direction and image size. The index repeats every caption, as text and as JSON, so a reviewer working from the files alone has every fact without the author's context.

**Nothing left out quietly.** The views are drawn from a temporary copy that reads as the design does in place: it keeps the design's own file names, and every model path the design's folder anchors is written out in full. Every two-dimensional view, and every tile of one, is composed in one place, which alone frames it, puts it on the dark background, draws its rule areas, names the layers it lacks and the fonts KiCad substituted, and writes its caption fields. So these hold for every two-dimensional view alike:

- A whole-board view frames everything KiCad draws on the board's plotted layers, united with the outline and the rule areas, with a millimetre to spare, so a part or a text reaching past the outline is drawn whole rather than cut off. A crop frames its circuit and the parts on its supply nets, and shows only what lies within the board coordinates its caption states.
- KiCad does not plot a rule area, so the command draws each one as a dashed, hatched outline on every two-dimensional view that shows one of its layers, the faint board beneath a net overlay or the class map included, wherever the view's region reaches the area, and that view's caption names it. The three-dimensional views do not draw rule areas.
- A fabrication or courtyard layer the board does not carry is named as not carried in the caption of every view that would show it. The board must carry every other layer a view shows.
- A font KiCad cannot find, whose text it draws in another, is named in every caption, the three-dimensional views' included.

The three-dimensional views say what they leave out in their own captions and in the index:

- A part drawn without a model is named: one whose model KiCad cannot find, one declaring no model, one whose model the design hides, and one marked do not populate. Which parts KiCad drew a model for is judged from KiCad's three-dimensional export of the same copy (`kicad-cli pcb export glb`), not from the rendered images, so a model the renderer loads but the export does not would be named as not found although it is drawn.
- A three-dimensional view is zoomed out until no part reaches its frame, and its caption states the zoom.

The command reports a model KiCad cannot find, a font it substitutes and a layer the board does not carry as lines of their own as well. A board with any of them still gets its views: whether what they leave out matters is the review's judgement.

Out of scope for this section: judging the images, which is the layout review step.
